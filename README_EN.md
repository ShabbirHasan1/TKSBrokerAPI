## Introduction

If you are engaged in investment, automation and algorithmic trading at the same time, then you have probably heard about [Tinkoff Open API](https://tinkoff.github.io/investAPI/) (there is a good [Swagger-documentation](https://tinkoff.github.io/investAPI/swagger-ui/)). This is an API provided by the Tinkoff Investments broker to automate the operation of exchange trading robots. If you haven't heard it yet, you can create an account [following the link](http://tinkoff.ru/sl/AaX1Et1omnH) and test its capabilities.

When working with any API, there are always technical difficulties: a high entry threshold, the need to study of the big volume of documentation, writing and debugging code to make network requests using the API format. It will take a long time before you get to the point of implementing a trading algorithm.

**[TKSBrokerAPI](https://github.com/Tim55667757/TKSBrokerAPI)** is a simpler tool that can be used as a regular python module or run from the command line, and immediately out of the box get the opportunity to work with an account with a Tinkoff Investments broker: receive information about the state of the portfolio, including elementary analytics, open and close positions, receive general information about the instruments traded on the exchange, request prices and receive reports on operations for the specified period. All data is output immediately to the console: in text view or saved in Markdown format files.

## Setup

The easiest way is to install via PyPI:

```commandline
pip install tksbrokerapi
```

After that, you can check the installation with the command:

```commandline
pip show tksbrokerapi
```

You can also use the TKSBrokerAPI module by downloading it directly from [repository](https://github.com/Tim55667757/TKSBrokerAPI/) via `git clone` and taking the codebase of any tested [release](https://github.com/Tim55667757/TKSBrokerAPI/releases).

In the first case, the tool will be available in the console through the `tksbrokerapi` command, and in the second case, you will have to run it as a normal python script, through `python TKSBrokerAPI.py` from the source directory.

Further, all examples are written for the case when TKSBrokerAPI is installed via PyPI.


## Auth

### Token

The TINKOFF INVEST API service uses a token for authentication. A token is a set of characters that encodes information about the owner, access rights, and other information required for authorization in the service. The token must be passed to the server with every network request.

The TKSBrokerAPI module takes care of all the work with tokens. There are three options for setting a user token:

- when calling `tksbrokerapi` in the console, specify the key: `--token "your_token_here"`;
- either specify `token` when initializing the class in a python script: [`TKSBrokerAPI.TinkoffBrokerServer(token="your_token_here", ...)`](https://tim55667757.github.io/TKSBrokerAPI/docs/tksbrokerapi/TKSBrokerAPI.html#TinkoffBrokerServer.__init__);
- or you can pre-set a special variable in the user environment: `TKS_API_TOKEN=your_token_here`.

‚ùó **Working with the TINKOFF INVEST API without creating and using a token is not possible**. Before you start working with the TKSBrokerAPI module, please open the [brokerage account in Tinkoff Investments](http://tinkoff.ru/sl/AaX1Et1omnH), and then select the type of token you need and create it as indicated [in official documentation](https://tinkoff.github.io/investAPI/token/).

‚ùó **Important note**: never share your tokens with anyone, don't use them in examples, and don't save them in public code. Anyone can use the token, but all transactions with the broker will be displayed on your behalf. If you want to use your tokens for automation in CI/CD systems, then be sure to use hidden environment variables ([example](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings) of setting "hidden variables" for Travis CI, and [example](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#protected-cicd-variables) of setting "protected variables" for GitLab CI).

### User account ID

The second important parameter for the operation of TKSBrokerAPI is the numeric identifier of the user's account. It is not mandatory, but without specifying it, it will be impossible to perform many operations through the API that are logically tied to a specific user (view a portfolio on a brokerage account, perform trading operations, and many others). You can find this number in any brokerage report, which can be ordered either from the Tinkoff Investments mobile application or in your account on their website. Usually the user account ID is located at the top, in the "header" of reports. You can also requested this number from the Tinkoff Investments technical support chat.

There are three options for setting the user account ID:

- when calling `tksbrokerapi` in the console, specify the key: `--account-id your_id_number"`;
- either specify `accountId` when initializing the class in a python script: [`TKSBrokerAPI.TinkoffBrokerServer(token="...", accountId=your_id_number, ...)`](https://tim55667757.github.io/TKSBrokerAPI/docs/tksbrokerapi/TKSBrokerAPI.html#TinkoffBrokerServer.__init__);
- or you can pre-set a special variable in the user environment: `TKS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_id_number`.


## Usage examples

Next, consider some scenarios for using the TKSBrokerAPI module: when it is launched in the console or as a python script.

‚ùó By default, level `INFO` information is displayed in the console. In case of any errors, it is recommended to increase the logging level to `DEBUG`. To do this, specify any of the keys together with the command: `--debug-level=10`, `--verbosity=10` or `-v 10`. After that, copy the logs with the problem and create a new bug in the section üëâ [**Issues**](https://github.com/Tim55667757/TKSBrokerAPI/issues/new) üëà, please.

Also, `DEBUG` level information is always output to the log-file `TKSBrokerAPI.log` (it is created in the working directory where `tksbrokerapi` or `python TKSBrokerAPI.py` script is called).

### Command line

When you run the program in the console, you can specify many parameters and perform one action. The format of any commands is as follows:

```commandline
tksbrokerapi [–Ω–µ–æ–±—è–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∫–ª—é—á–∏ –∏ –ø–∞—Ä–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä—ã] [–æ–¥–Ω–æ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ]
```

‚ùó To execute most commands, you must each time specify your token through the `--token` key and the account ID through the `--account-id` key, or set them once with the `TKS_API_TOKEN` and `TKS_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variables (see section ["Auth"](#Auth)).

*Note: in the examples below, the access token and account ID were pre-set via the `TKS_API_TOKEN` and `TKS_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variables, so the `--token` and `--account-id` keys do not appear in the logs.*

#### Reference

The `--help` (`-h`) key is used, no action need to specify. The list of keys relevant for this release and their description will be displayed in the console.

#### Get a list of all instruments available for trading

The `--list` (`-l`) key is used. At the same time, information is requested from the broker's server on the instruments available for the current account. Additionally, you can use the `--output` key to specify the file where you want to save the received data in Markdown format (by default, `instruments.md` in the current working directory). The `--debug-level=10` key will output all debugging information to the console (not nesessary to specify it).

#### Get information about an instrument

The key `--info` (`-i`) is used, and one of the two parameters must be specified: the instrument's ticker, or its FIGI ID. They are specified by the `--ticker` (`-t`) and `--figi` (`-f`) keys, respectively. The information displayed to the user is the same for both keys. The difference is in the content and number of fields displayed in the information table, depending on the type of instrument found: it is a currency, stock, bond, fund or futures.

#### Request Depth of Market with a specified depth

The `--price` key is used, and one of the two parameters must be specified: the instrument's ticker (the `--ticker` or `-t` key), or its FIGI identifier (the `--figi` or `-f` key), respectively . Additionally, you can specify the `--depth` key to set the "depth of the order book". The actual given depth is determined by the broker's policies for a particular instrument, it can be much less than the requested one.

#### Get a report on operations with a portfolio for a specified period

The key `--deals` (`-d`) is used, after which you need to specify two dates: the start and end dates of the report. They must be in the format `%Y-%m-%d` and separated by a space, e.g. `--deals 2022-07-01 2022-07-27`. In this case, the report will include all transactions from 0:00:00 on the first date to 23:59:59 on the second date.

Instead of the start date, you can specify a negative number ‚Äî the number of previous days from the current date (`--deals -1`, `-d -2`, `-d -3`, ...), then you do not need to specify the end date. Also, instead of the start date, you can specify one of the keywords: `today`, `yesterday` (-1 day), `week` (-7 days), `month` (-30 days), `year` (-365 days) . In all these cases, a report will be issued for the specified number of previous days up to today and the current time.

Additionally, you can specify the `--output` key to specify the file where to save the report on deals in Markdown format (by default, `report.md` in the current working directory).

#### Make a deal on the market

At the beginning, you should specify the `--ticker` or `--figi` key to specify the instrument for which there will be a market order. To make a deal "at the market", that is, at current prices in the order book, use the common key `--trade`, after which you need to specify from 1 to 5 parameters in the strict order of their sequence:

- direction: `Buy` or `Sell` ‚Äî required parameter;
- optional parameters:
  - number of instrument lots, integer >= 1, default 1;
  - take profit level, fractional number >= 0, default 0 (if 0, no take profit order will be placed);
  - stop loss level, fractional number >= 0, default 0 (if 0, stop loss order will not be placed);
  - expiration date of take profit and stop loss orders, by default the string `Undefined` (in this case orders will be valid until canceled) or you can set the date in the format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:% S`.

You can also use more simple keys to perform buy and sell operations on the market `--buy` or `--sell`, for which you can set up to 4 optional parameters:

- number of instrument lots, integer >= 1, default 1;
- take profit level, fractional number >= 0, default 0 (if 0, no take profit order will be placed);
- stop loss level, fractional number >= 0, default 0 (if 0, stop loss order will not be placed);
- expiration date of take profit and stop loss orders, by default the string `Undefined` (in this case orders will be valid until canceled) or you can set the date in the format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:% S`.

#### Open a pending limit or stop order

At the beginning, you should specify the `--ticker` or `--figi` key to specify the instrument for which the order will be placed. To open a pending order of any type, you can use the common key `--order`, after which you need to specify from 4 to 7 parameters in strict order:

- direction: `Buy` or `Sell` ‚Äî required parameter;
- order type: `Limit` (valid until the end of the trading session) or `Stop` (valid until canceled or until the specified date) ‚Äî required parameter;
- number of instrument lots, integer >= 1 ‚Äî required parameter;
- target trigger price of the initial order, fractional number >= 0 ‚Äî required parameter;
- optional parameters and only for stop orders:
  - price of the opened limit order, fractional number >= 0, default 0 (if 0, a market order will be immediately placed instead of a limit order, when the trigger price of the initial stop order is reached);
  - type of order opened upon reaching the trigger price of the initial stop order, by default it is the string `Limit` or you can specify `SL`, `TP` to open a stop loss or take profit order;
    - stop-loss order is always opened at the market price;
  - date of cancellation of take profit and stop loss orders, by default the string `Undefined` (in this case orders will be valid until canceled) or you can set the date in the format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:% S`.

You can use more simple keys to place pending limit orders (valid until the end of the trading session) `--buy-limit` or `--sell-limit`, for which you need to specify only 2 required parameters:

- number of instrument lots, integer >= 1 ‚Äî required parameter;
- target price for triggering a limit order, fractional number >= 0 ‚Äî required parameter;
  - for a `--buy-limit` order, the target price must be lower than the current price, and if it is higher, the broker will immediately open a market order to buy, as if the `--buy` command was executed;
  - for a `--sell-limit` order, the target price must be higher than the current price, and if it is lower, the broker will immediately open a market order to sell, as if the `--sell` command was executed.

You can use more simple keys to place pending stop orders (valid until canceled or until a specified date) `--buy-stop` or `--sell-stop`, for which you only need to specify 2 required parameters and 3 optional:

- number of instrument lots, integer >= 1 ‚Äî required parameter;
- target stop order trigger price, fractional number >= 0 ‚Äî required parameter;
- optional parameters:
  - price of the opened limit order, fractional number >= 0, default 0 (if 0, a market order will be immediately placed instead of a limit order, when the trigger price of the initial stop order is reached);
  - type of order opened upon reaching the trigger price of the initial stop order, by default it is the string `Limit` or you can specify `SL`, `TP` to open a stop loss or take profit order;
    - stop-loss order is always opened at the market price;
  - date of cancellation of take profit and stop loss orders, by default the string `Undefined` (in this case orders will be valid until canceled) or you can set the date in the format `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:% S`.

#### Cancel orders and close positions

Order IDs and instrument tickers for which positions are open can be found in the client's portfolio by running the `tksbrokerapi --overview` command. They will be needed for the operations below.

To close one order of any type by its ID, you can use the `--close-order` (`--cancel-order`) key followed by a unique order ID. To close orders by list, you can use the similar key `--close-orders` (`--cancel-orders`), after which followed all order identifiers.

To close a previously opened position (both "long" or "short") use the `--close-trade` (`--cancel-trade`) key, preceded by the instrument with the `--ticker key `. In fact, a market order is opened with the direction opposite to the open position. To close positions for several instruments, you can use the similar key `--close-trades` (`--cancel-trades`), after which define the required tickers (the `--ticker` key is no longer required).

You can also use the common key `--close-all` (`--cancel-all`). If you specify it without parameters, then an attempt will be made to close all instruments and orders, except for those that are blocked or not available for trading. First, all orders will be closed, otherwise, for example, limit orders may block the closing of part of the available volumes for instruments. Then, in order, positions will be closed for all instruments: stocks, bonds, ETFs and futures. This key is more convenient when you need to urgently close all positions than to perform these operations one by one.

‚ùó It is important to note that in the current version of TKSBrokerAPI, open currency positions will not be closed with the `--close-all` (`--cancel-all`) key. This is because other instruments may use different base currencies. In addition, the user may not want to reduce their currency positions in order to buy other instruments with these funds in the future. If necessary, currency positions can be closed manually using the keys `--buy`, `--sell`, `--close-trade` or `--close-trades`.

To selectively reduce positions, you can use the `--close-all` (`--cancel-all`) key, followed by one or more instrument's types, separated by spaces:
- `orders` ‚Äî close all orders (both limit and stop orders),
- `shares` ‚Äî close all stock positions,
- `bonds` ‚Äî close all positions on bonds,
- `etfs` ‚Äî close all ETFs positions,
- `futures` ‚Äî close all futures positions,
- but, you can not specify `currencies` ‚Äî to close all positions in currencies, due to the reasons described above.

### Module import

Full documentation of all available properties and methods of the `TKSBrokerAPI.TinkoffBrokerServer()` class can be found [by the link](https://tim55667757.github.io/TKSBrokerAPI/docs/tksbrokerapi/TKSBrokerAPI.html). You can also see the correspondence between keys and methods in the ["Key features"](#Key-features) section.

Using the TKSBrokerAPI module, you can implement any trading scenario in Python. Many different system used for making trading decisions about buying or selling (technical analysis, neural networks, parsing reports or tracking other traders‚Äô transactions), but you still need to perform trading operations: place orders, open and close transactions. The `TKSBrokerAPI` module will act as an intermediary between the code with the trading logic and the infrastructure of the Tinkoff Investments broker, as well as perform routine tasks on your behalf in [brokerage account](http://tinkoff.ru/sl/AaX1Et1omnH).

‚ùó **Important note**: the TKSBrokerAPI module is not intended for high-frequency (HFT) trading, due to the system of dynamic limit generation for TINKOFF INVEST API users (for more details [see the link](https://tinkoff.github.io/investAPI/limits/)). On average, this is 50-300 requests per second, depending on their type, which is very low for the requirements for HFT speeds (there are [several recommendations](https://tinkoff.github.io/investAPI/speedup/) to speed up execution orders). However, you can use it to automate your intraday, short, medium and long term trading strategies.

#### Abstract scenario implementation example

In this documentation, we do not want to focus on specific trading scenarios, but only show the possibilities for automating them. Therefore, let's consider one simple but completely fictional scenario, and implement it using the TKSBrokerAPI module. The actions will be the following:

- requesting the client's current portfolio and determining funds available for trading;
- request for a Depth of Market with a depth of 20 for the selected instrument, for example, shares with the ticker `IBM`;
- if the instrument was not purchased earlier, then checking:
  - if the buying volumes in the DOM are at least 50% higher than the selling volumes, then buy 1 share on the market and place the take profit as a stop order 5% higher than the current buy price with an expire period until cancellation;
- if the instrument is in the list of open positions, then checking:
   - if the current price is 3% higher than the average position price, then place the take profit as a pending limit order 0.05% more higher than the current price so that the position is closed with a profit with a high probability during the current session.
- requesting the current user's portfolio.

To understand the example, save and run the script under the spoiler below. Before doing this, don't forget to get a token and find out your accountId (see the section ["Auth"](#Auth)).
